Notes:,,,,,,,,
1. The source for all information in this release is Employment and Social Development Canada's (ESDC) LMIA System. ,,,,,,,,
"2. Global Talent Stream two-year pilot was launched on June 12, 2017 for all provinces/territories except Quebec, where it was launched on September 11, 2017.",,,,,,,,
"3. A positive LMIA in support of Permanent Residence (PR) does not allow a foreign national to automatically immigrate to or be granted PR status in Canada. Successful PR applicants under Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada's (IRCC) Express Entry system enter Canada with a permanent resident visa, never as TFW.",,,,,,,,
"4. Each LMIA application submitted is restricted to a single occupation, as defined by the NOC; however, it may be for any number of positions (for example, five welders).
(for example, five nannies).
",,,,,,,,
"5. The LMIA System tracks TFW positions only, not TFWs who are issued a work permit or who enter Canada. Not all positions approved result in a work permit or a TFW entering Canada. For information on the number of work permits issued, please consult Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada's (IRCC) Facts and Figures: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/statistics/menu-fact.asp ",,,,,,,,
6. The numbers appearing in this release may differ slightly from those reported in previous releases of LMIA statistics due to data updates that occur over time.,,,,,,,,
"7. As of the publication of 2023 annual data (published in April 2024), all LMIAs in support of 'Permanent Residence (PR) Only' are included in TFWP statistics, unless indicated otherwise. All annual data in this report includes PR Only LMIAs. Dual-intent LMIAs and corresponding positions are included under their respective TFWP stream (e.g., low-wage, high-wage, etc.) This may impact program reporting over time.",,,,,,,,
