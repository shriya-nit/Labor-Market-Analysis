1. The source for all information in this release is Employment and Social Development Canada's (ESDC) LMIA System. ,,,,,,,,
"2. Effective November 2016, NOC 2011 is being used. Prior to November 2016, all occupations under NOC 2006 had been converted to the respective NOC 2011 occupation. Empirical concordance released by Statistics was used to determine appropriate linkages.",,,,,,,,
"3. Each LMIA application submitted is restricted to a single occupation, as defined by the NOC; however, it may be for any number of positions (for example, five welders).

",,,,,,,,
"4. The LMIA System tracks TFW positions only, not TFWs who are issued a work permit or who enter Canada. Not all positions approved result in a work permit or a TFW entering Canada. For information on the number of work permits issued, please consult Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada's (IRCC) Facts and Figures: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/statistics/menu-fact.asp ",,,,,,,,
5. The numbers appearing in this release may differ slightly from those reported in previous releases of LMIA statistics due to data updates that occur over time.,,,,,,,,
"6. As of the publication of 2023 annual data (published in April 2024), all LMIAs in support of 'Permanent Residence (PR) Only' are included in TFWP statistics, unless indicated otherwise. All annual data in this report includes PR Only LMIAs. Dual-intent LMIAs and corresponding positions are included under their respective TFWP stream (e.g., low-wage, high-wage, etc.) This may impact program reporting over time.",,,,,,,,
