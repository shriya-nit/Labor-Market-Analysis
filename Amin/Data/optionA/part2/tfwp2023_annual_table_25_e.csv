All annual data in this report includes PR Only LMIAs. Dual-intent LMIAs and corresponding positions are included under their respective TFWP stream (e.g., low-wage, high-wage, etc.) This may impact program reporting over time.

An economic region is defined by Statistics Canada as a grouping of complete Census Divisions (with one exception in Ontario) created as a standard geographic unit for analysis of regional economic activity. There are 76 economic regions across Canada. In Ontario, there is one exception where the employers� boundary does not respect census division boundaries: The census division of Halton is split between the employers of Hamilton�Niagara Peninsula and the employers of Toronto.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
