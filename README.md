# Temporary Foreign Worker Program Labour Market Impact Assessment(LMIA) 2016-2023

This project aimed to develop a comprehensive view of the Labour Market Impact Assessments (LMIAs) issues for the Temporary Foreign Worker (TFW) positions in Canada for the year 2016-2023. 
An analysis of the data on positive and negative assessments by region, occupation, wage, and industry-specific programs (such as Seasonal Agriculture Worker Program) was performed along with assessing the program’s influence on the Canadian labor market across various industries and regions. The real life impact on the new measure of Employment and Social Development services was also suggested.
