# Temporary Foreign Worker Program Labour Market Impact Assessment(LMIA) 2016-2023

This project aimed to develop a comprehensive view of the Labour Market Impact Assessments (LMIAs) issues for the Temporary Foreign Worker (TFW) positions in Canada for the year 2016-2023. 
An analysis of the data on positive and negative assessments by region, occupation, wage, and industry-specific programs (such as Seasonal Agriculture Worker Program) was performed along with assessing the programâ€™s influence on the Canadian labor market across various industries and regions. The real life impact on the new measure of Employment and Social Development services was also suggested.
